<strong>Hello, my name is Chris, also known as TwentiesFour. I am 22 years old and come from Heidelberg. Video games have been with me since my childhood. My first experiences were on the Game Boy Advance SP, where I tried to catch little creatures with a ball. Later, I switched to the computer and played classics like Age of Empires, Stronghold, and Need for Speed. I also owned a Playstation 3 and Playstation 4 before eventually returning to the computer, where I mainly play to this day. For local game nights with friends or family, I bought a Nintendo Switch. My current favorite game is Overwatch 2.

Currently, I am investing a lot of time and effort in expanding my programming skills and deepening my understanding of various programming languages and technologies. I am not only working on the development of letszock.de, but also on other exciting projects that focus on various areas such as web development, app development, and data analysis.</strong>
